## Description

A powershell profile with alias and useful functions to make terminal life a bit simpler. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Any version of powershell
* Recommend powershell 7.x using latest Stable Build of Windows Terminal
* I use Vim as my terminal text editor. You would need to install VIM and make sure vim.exe is in your Users or System's Path Variable

```
$ENV:Path
WARNING: Please be cautious when editing environment variables in your system, to be safe use User PATH, not System.
